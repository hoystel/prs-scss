				<p>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 09:24:37 +0100</p>
				<p>
					
					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; line-height: 115%"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; color: black; line-height: 115%"> The UK&rsquo;s 28.6 million homes grew in value by almost &pound;1.4 billion per day in 2015 with Brentford, West Drayton and Thame seeing the largest increases, new research shows.</span><p>Brentford in London saw prices increase by 24% and West Drayton and Thame both by 17%, according to the data from property website Zoopla, while Wales saw the lowest prices gains at 2.2% over the last 12 months.</p><p>The figures show that homes are now worth a combined &pound;7.76 trillion with the total value of residential properties up by 7.2% or &pound;519 billion in 2015. This means that the average British property is now worth &pound;290,827.</p><p>Home owners in London have seen the highest price growth in 2015 of any region, with an 11.8% annual uplift. The East of England follows closely with an 11.6% rise, up from 9.6% during 2014. </p><p>However, property owners in Wales and Scotland saw the lowest growth in house prices in the last 12 months, with values rising just 2.2% and 2.7% respectively.<br /> <br />London, Edinburgh, and Bristol were the top three most searched for locations by British house hunters on Zoopla in 2015. Northern areas also performed well, with Glasgow rising in the rankings, moving from sixth place in 2014 to fourth place this year, while Leeds broke into the top 10, coming in eighth.<br /> <br />Amongst the most popular keyword searches over the past year were &lsquo;bungalow&rsquo;, &lsquo;cottage&rsquo; and &lsquo;village&rsquo;, with aspirational property also searchers for homes offering a &lsquo;pool&rsquo; and a &lsquo;sea view.&rsquo;<br /> <br />&lsquo;Whilst the property market typically slows at this time of the year, prices have performed well in 2015, with some standout towns such as Brentford faring particularly well. Regions like East Anglia continue to boom as professionals and families seek out properties beyond the London commuter belt,&rsquo; said Lawrence Hall of Zoopla.</p><p>&lsquo;Even regions like Wales, where growth has typically been very incremental, have totalled respectable annual growth rates. Of course, to every silver lining there must be a cloud and the price rises we&rsquo;re seeing do make it harder for those looking to take their first step onto the ladder,&rsquo; he pointed out.</p><p>&lsquo;But with Government Help to Buy schemes still in place and the promise of new homes to ease demand both buyers and sellers should have at least some reason to be upbeat as we go into 2016,&rsquo; he added.</p>

It will come into force on 01 July 2016 under a new Bill before Parliament.</p><p>Revenue Minister Todd McClay said that the RLWT will act as a collection mechanism for the new bright-line test, which applies to gains from the sale of residential property purchased on or after 01 October 2015 and sold within two years.</p><p>&lsquo;The proposed RLWT will ensure the integrity of the tax system and will bring the collection of bright-line tax into line with other withholding taxes, which generally apply when there is likely to be a tax liability and collection may be difficult,&rsquo; he explained.</p><p>RLWT will apply when the property being sold is located in New Zealand and defined as residential land under the bright-line test provisions; when the seller acquired the property on or after 01 October 2015 and has owned the property for less than two years before selling it; and the seller is an offshore person.</p><p>An offshore person would include people who are not New Zealand citizens, people who do not hold residence class visas and New Zealand citizens and residence class visa holders who have been away from New Zealand for a significant period of time, three years in the case of New Zealand citizens.</p><p>New Zealand trusts and companies may also be considered offshore persons if they have significant offshore interests in them.</p><p>&lsquo;Unlike the bright-line test there is no exception for the seller&rsquo;s main home under the proposed new RLWT rules. As the withholding tax would only apply to a person living overseas, it is unlikely that the New Zealand property being sold would be the person&rsquo;s main home,&rsquo; said McClay.</p><p>The Bill does, however, propose an exemption from RLWT for transfers upon death, and for transfers made in relation to a property relationship agreement, in keeping with the bright-line test.</p><p>The Bill also proposes that the obligation to pay the RLWT will primarily be the responsibility of seller&rsquo;s conveyancing agent or in their absence, the purchaser&rsquo;s conveyancing agent and in the absence of both, directly by the purchaser.</p><p>&lsquo;The RLWT proposal in the bill, together with the new bright-line test and changes to collect better tax information about buyers and sellers of residential property will help to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax on gains from property sales,&rsquo; added McClay.</p>

In a further sign of commercial property market health, the value of distressed loans fell from &pound;23.2 billion at the end of 2014 to &pound;15.7 billion by the middle of 2015. </p><p>The report also show that the proportion of loans with a loan to value (LTV) ratio of less than 70% has continued to grow in the first half of 2015, representing 80.5%, or &pound;135.5 billion of outstanding debt of the traditional lenders and allocated to investment projects. </p><p>Outstanding debt with a LTV ratio of between 71% and 100% fell from 14.3% of the total of &pound;20 billion at the end of 2014 to 12% or &pound;16 billon by the middle of 2015. </p><p>The first half of the year also showed an encouraging pick-up in development finance, particularly for speculative or partly pre-let projects, where more non-traditional lenders now feel comfortable providing finance against such schemes.</p><p>At the same time, the research suggests that banking regulation may be having an adverse impact on development finance by the traditional lenders. At the middle of 2015, only 2.8% of debt was allocated to commercial development projects by these lenders. </p><p>Interest rate margins for senior debt continued their three-year long decline but the pace of decline has moderated considerably. By the middle of 2015, the average margin for senior loans secured by prime office property was recorded at 214bps, down from 218.7bps recorded at the end of 2014. The report suggests that that the floor in interest-rate margins may have been reached.</p><p>Following a surge in non-traditional lenders in 2014, Banks and Building Societies remained the dominant lenders in the market, holding 76% of all loan originations at the middle year point compared to 75% at the end of 2014. The level of new lending by UK Banks and Building Societies remained stable at 39% of all loan originations.</p><p>&lsquo;We seem to have reached a turning point in the amount of commercial property debt in the market, with the impact of post-crisis deleveraging almost totally...

					<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; line-height: 115%"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; color: black; line-height: 115%"> The extra 3% stamp duty tax being levied on buy to let and second home buyers in April 2016 means that it may no longer be financially viable for new entrants to the lower end of the private landlord market, it is claimed.</span><p>And the new tax band will have a disproportionate impact on pensioners looking to generate revenue in retirement, according to Chestertons, one of London&#39;s largest estate agents.</p><p>The announcement of the additional levy on second homes and buy to let purchases came as a surprise announcement in the Chancellor&#39;s Autumn Statement, and initially caused some confusion across the industry as pundits disagreed on how the additional 3% would be applied.</p><p>Chestertons has now calculated that the extra duty will hit the lower end of the market more heavily in terms of a percentage increase than it will the higher end. A buy to let property acquired for &pound;150,000 attracts stamp duty of &pound;500, but under the new regime it rises to &pound;5,000, a tenfold increase.</p><p>By comparison, an investor buying a property for &pound;1 million currently pays &pound;43,750 in stamp duty, while the new rate will be &pound;73,750, less than double the original duty, although of course a larger amount in cash terms.  </p><p>&lsquo;The Chancellor claimed that this change to stamp duty would prevent wealthy investors and overseas buyers from pricing first time buyers out of the market, but as usual the devil&#39;s in the detail,&rsquo; said Nick Barnes, head of research at Chestertons.</p><p>&lsquo;What we can now see is that this change is likely to completely deter many first time landlords from getting into the private rental market in the first place, including pensioners looking to wisely reinvest their precious pension pot,&rsquo; he pointed out.<br />&lsquo;<br />The obvious effect of this will be that there may well be a significant number of smaller landlords deterred from entering the sector altogether. Those who remain will have their margins slashed and, on top of the increasing regulatory burden and the planned reduction in mortgage interest relief, they may have to raise the rent in order to make the numbers stack up. Either way, the already highly competitive private rental market is about to get a whole lot more so,&rsquo; he added.</p><p>According to Robert Bartlett, chief executive officer of Chestertons, the industry had hoped that the Chancellor might have announced stamp duty change that would have helped the current negative impact on sales above &pound;1 million. </p><p>&lsquo;We&#39;d hoped he might consider capping rates, or reducing them by 3%, so you can imagine the dismay when this extra surcharge was announced. The buy to let sector has become an essential part of the UK housing landscape and we urge the Chancellor to think clearly around the rules for when this is being introduced,&rsquo; he said.</p><p>He pointed out that a number of key questions still need to be answered, for example whether a buy to let investor who has contracted...
